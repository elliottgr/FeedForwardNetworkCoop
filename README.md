# Evolution of cooperation mediated by complex social traits
This repository contains code used to model the evolution of complex social traits. Here, a complex social trait is differentiated from a "simple" one by the number of parameters determining its social behavior. Classical models of evolving social interaction (such as those presented by Hamilton, Price, Axelrod, etc.) considered social behavior as captured by a single variable representing an individual's level of altruism. This model draws on work of Le Nagard et al. (2011) to consider the evolution of a complex trait, where an individual's willingness to cooperate is represented by several individually evolving traits. We use a feedforward neural network to capture this complexity, with individual node weights and biases representing the evolving components of the overall social trait.
